Hi, I'm Tobias Case and this is my first model.  The skeleton is gman,
but because of the nature of a toothpaste tube, I had to make a lot of
custom animations or simply edit existing ones.

Vertices:  132
Triangles: 262

Thanks to Valve, Chumbalum Soft's Milkshape 3D 1.3.1, Aqua Fresh Tartar
Control Toothpaste, and my twin brother for letting me borrow his scanner.

Note:  In the Half-Life Model Viewer, the lower body of the model appears
differently than in game for crouched animations.  This is due to
Half-Life only reading the upper body for reference.  When making this
model I found it unnecessary to redo the whole body for these animations,
because it looks great in-game.

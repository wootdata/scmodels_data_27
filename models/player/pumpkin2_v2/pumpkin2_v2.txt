	It is said that once apon a time on the darkest of eves a man
had begun a stroll along the street.  He came across a vendor of goods
and decided to stop for a look.  Little did he know that this "vendor"
was no vendor at all.  He was a murderer.  The "vendor" pulled from his
pouch a serated blade and slit the neck of the defensless man.... His
head rolled down the street and was never again seen.  This man still 
haunts the streets..... He wheres the pumpkin head just for fun. : )

folder were ever your other models are.
